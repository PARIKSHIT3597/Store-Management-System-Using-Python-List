# Store Management System Using Python List

## Overview

This project is a simple Store Management System implemented in Python, using lists for data storage. It allows users to manage store inventory, process sales, and track product details without the need for external databases. The system is ideal for learning Python fundamentals and understanding basic data structures and logic for managing inventory in a retail environment.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Add, edit, and delete products from the inventory.
- **Sales Processing**: Record sales and update inventory levels accordingly.
- **Inventory Tracking**: View current stock levels and product information.
- **Simple CLI Interface**: Interact with the system using a command-line interface.
- **Data Stored in Lists**: All data is managed in-memory using Python lists.
